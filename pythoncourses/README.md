    - Understanding control flow in Python: Get a deeper understanding of how control structures guide the flow of execution in a Python program.
    - Break and continue statements: Learn how to use break and continue to alter the flow of your loops.
    - Nested loops: Understand how to use loops inside other loops, and when it might be useful.
    - Loop control with else: Learn about the else clause in loops, which is executed when the loop finishes normally (i.e., it didn't encounter a break statement).
    - The pass statement: Understand the use of pass statement, which is a placeholder and usually used when the code is not yet implemented.
